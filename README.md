# Ada Off-by-One Loop Error

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error that can occur in Ada loops when using subtypes and array indexing.  The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides the corrected version.

The issue arises from the loop condition and how the index is incremented and checked.

**How to run:**
1.  Compile and run `bug.ada` to observe the incorrect output.
2. Compile and run `bugSolution.ada` to see the corrected output.
